# Plant Disease Classification

  This project focuses on identifying diseases in plant leaves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset includes images of various plants, such as corn, potato, and tomato, affected by different diseases.

## Key Modules & Libraries Used
  1. NumPy: For numerical computations.
  2.Pandas: For data handling and analysis.
  3. Matplotlib: For visualizing images and results.
  4. Keras & TensorFlow: For building and training the CNN model.
  5. Sklearn: For splitting data into training and testing sets.

## Preprocessing Steps
  1. Data Visualization
  2. Image Resizing 
  3. Data Augmentation

## Model Performance
  The CNN model achieved a validation accuracy of 99.31%.
